# User Story

# Acceptance Criteria
*GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work WHEN I load their portfolio*

*THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

*WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

*WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

*WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
