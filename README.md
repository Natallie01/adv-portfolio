Advanced CSS Challenge Portfolio

# User Story
AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

# Acceptance Criteria
_GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work WHEN I load their portfolio_

_THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them_

_WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section_

_WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications_

_WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others_

_WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application_

_WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport_
